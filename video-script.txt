Event Manager video script (2:00–2:20 target)

Intro (10s)
Hi, this is my Event Manager app built with Express, EJS, and SQLite. I will show the main pages, the organiser workflow, the attendee booking flow, and the extension for booking management.

Main home page (10s)
At the root URL you can see a minimal home page with links to the organiser and attendee areas.

Organiser home page (25s)
On the organiser home page, the site name and description are pulled from the database. I can create new events, and I can see separate lists for published and draft events. Each item shows title, date, created and published timestamps, and ticket capacities and prices for full and concession tickets.

Create + edit event (25s)
I will create a new event. This creates a draft record and redirects to the edit page. The edit form lets me update the title, description, date, and ticket capacities and prices. When I save, the updated timestamp is refreshed.

Publish event (15s)
Back on the organiser home page, I can publish a draft. Publishing updates the status, timestamps the publication date, and moves the event into the published list.

Attendee home page (15s)
On the attendee home page, published events are listed in date order so the next event appears first. The site name and description are the same settings from the database.

Attendee event page + booking (30s)
Clicking an event opens the attendee event page. It shows the event details, ticket prices, and remaining availability. I enter my name, choose ticket quantities, and book. The server validates availability and stores the booking in SQLite. After booking, the confirmation message appears and the availability updates.

Extension: organiser booking management (30s)
For the extension, each published event has a “View bookings” link. This page shows total full and concession bookings and lists each booking with attendee name, quantities, and timestamp. I can cancel a booking, which deletes the record and updates the totals.

Wrap up (10s)
That is the full workflow with server-side rendering and persistent storage in SQLite, plus the organiser booking management extension.
